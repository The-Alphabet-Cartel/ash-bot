## üéØ How Crisis Detection Works

### **Three Crisis Levels**

**üî¥ HIGH Crisis** - *Immediate Response Required*
- **Detected Language**: Suicidal ideation, self-harm plans, severe despair
- **Ash Response**: Immediate support + crisis resources
- **Team Alert**: Red alert in crisis response channel + role ping
- **Staff DM**: PapaBearDoes receives detailed private message
- **Examples**: "want to die," "kill myself," "have a plan," "better off without me"

**üü° MEDIUM Crisis** - *Team Awareness Needed*
- **Detected Language**: Significant distress, hopelessness, struggling language
- **Ash Response**: Supportive reply + gentle resource suggestions
- **Team Alert**: Orange alert in crisis response channel 
- **Examples**: "everything feels pointless," "can't handle this," "really struggling"

**üü¢ LOW Crisis** - *Gentle Support*
- **Detected Language**: Mild distress, sadness, emotional difficulty
- **Ash Response**: Validation + encouragement
- **Team Alert**: None (handled by Ash)
- **Examples**: "feeling down," "rough day," "overwhelmed"

### **ü§ñ Enhanced Detection System**

Ash v2.0 uses a sophisticated multi-layered approach:

1. **Keyword Matching** - Built-in + your custom keywords
2. **AI Analysis** - Depression detection + sentiment analysis (runs on 10.20.30.16)
3. **Context Intelligence** - Distinguishes jokes, movies, games from real crisis language
4. **Learning Adjustments** - Applies community-trained sensitivity modifications
5. **Smart Filtering** - Advanced protection against false positives

## üÜò Crisis Response Workflows

### **When You Get a HIGH Crisis Alert (üî¥)**

1. **‚ö° Immediate Response Required**
   - Check crisis response channel for team coordination
   - **Say**: "I see this alert, responding now" (in crisis channel)

2. **üìä Assess Accuracy**
   - If the alert seems inappropriate, use `/report_false_positive`
   - If it's accurate, proceed with response

3. **ü§ù Coordinate Response**
   - **One primary responder** reaches out directly to the person
   - Others provide support in crisis channel
   - Avoid overwhelming the person with multiple responders

4. **üìû Escalate if Needed**
   - Professional resources in #resources channel
   - Emergency services if immediate physical danger

5. **üìã Staff Notification**
   - PapaBearDoes automatically receives detailed DM with full context

### **When You Get a MEDIUM Crisis Alert (üü°)**

1. **üëÄ Monitor the Situation**
   - Review the message and context
   - Watch for signs of escalation

2. **üìä Assess Accuracy**
   - If inappropriate, use `/report_false_positive`
   - Note if similar language should be higher/lower priority

3. **ü§ó Provide Additional Support**
   - If the person needs more than Ash's initial response
   - Gentle check-in or additional resources

4. **üìà Watch for Patterns**
   - Notice community-specific language that might need keywords

### **When You Notice Missed Crises**

1. **üö® Report Immediately**
   - Use `/report_missed_crisis` for any crisis Ash should have caught
   - Include context about why it was a crisis

2. **‚ûï Add Keywords**
   - Use `/add_keyword` for community-specific language patterns
   - Consider LGBTQIA+ specific terminology

3. **üìä Monitor Improvement**
   - Check `/learning_stats` to see how the system adapts
   - Watch for similar situations to see if detection improves

## üß† Understanding the Learning System

### **How Learning Works**

The v2.0 learning system operates on two levels:

**Local Learning (Bot)**
- Tracks your reports in local database
- Immediate pattern recognition
- Statistics and trend analysis

**AI Learning (NLP Server at 10.20.30.16)**
- Advanced pattern analysis using depression + sentiment models
- Real-time sensitivity adjustments
- Context-aware improvements

### **Learning Limits & Safety**
- **Maximum 50 learning adjustments per day** (prevents over-tuning)
- **Confidence threshold 0.6** (only high-confidence adjustments applied)
- **Human oversight required** (all changes tracked and logged)

### **Learning Statistics Example**
```
üìä Comprehensive Learning Statistics
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Overall Learning Progress
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ False Positives: 154 (over-detection)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Missed Crises: 93 (under-detection)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Total Reports: 247
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Improvements Made: 89 detection adjustments
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Recent Trends (30 Days)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Over-Detection Rate: 12.3%
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Under-Detection Rate: 8.1%
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Learning Rate: 2.3 reports/day
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Balance: Slightly over-sensitive
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Learning System Status
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NLP Server: ‚úÖ Connected
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Real-time Learning: Enabled
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Patterns Learned: 47 community-specific
```

## üìä Advanced Analytics & Monitoring

### **What to Monitor**

**Detection Accuracy Trends**
- Are false positives decreasing over time?
- Are we catching more real crises?
- Is the system balanced or too sensitive in either direction?

**Community Language Evolution**
- New phrases emerging in your community
- LGBTQIA+ specific terminology not being caught
- Generational language changes

**Team Response Effectiveness**
- Response times to alerts
- Coordination efficiency
- Member feedback on support quality

### **Using Learning Data for Improvements**

**If Over-Detection Rate is High (>15%)**
- Focus on reporting false positives
- Look for common patterns in inappropriate alerts
- Consider context clues (gaming, movies, work stress)

**If Under-Detection Rate is High (>10%)**
- Focus on reporting missed crises
- Add community-specific keywords
- Pay attention to subtle distress language

**If System is Balanced (5-10% each)**
- Continue current approach
- Fine-tune specific edge cases
- Focus on community-specific adaptations

## üéØ Best Practices for v2.0

### **Keyword Management**

**‚úÖ Good Keywords to Add:**
- Community-specific language: "dysphoria overwhelming," "family rejected me"
- Generational terminology: "no cap feeling hopeless," "lowkey suicidal"
- Identity-specific distress: "closet suffocating," "transition regret"
- Subtle crisis language: "not doing great," "pretty rough"

**‚ùå Keywords to Avoid:**
- Common gaming terms: "killed," "destroyed," "murdered"
- Movie/entertainment language: "dead," "dying," "killed me"
- Work stress without crisis context: "overwhelming project"
- Casual expressions: "I'm dead" (from laughter)

### **Learning System Usage**

**Report False Positives When:**
- Ash flagged gaming, movie, or entertainment discussion
- Common expressions were misinterpreted (e.g., "I'm dead tired")
- Work stress or school pressure was over-flagged
- Jokes or humor were detected as crisis

**Report Missed Crises When:**
- Clear distress signals went unnoticed
- Community-specific crisis language wasn't caught
- Subtle but genuine crisis expressions were missed
- Identity-specific distress wasn't recognized

**Use Learning Stats to:**
- Track improvement trends monthly
- Identify if system is too sensitive or not sensitive enough
- Understand which types of errors are most common
- Guide team training and awareness

## üö´ What NOT to Do

### **Common Mistakes**
- **Don't ignore alerts** - even if no immediate action needed, awareness is important
- **Don't assume others will respond** - coordinate in crisis channel
- **Don't overwhelm the person** - one primary responder, others support
- **Don't report learning errors hastily** - consider context carefully
- **Don't add keywords without team discussion** - might increase false positives

### **Learning System Cautions**
- **Don't report every minor issue** - focus on clear errors
- **Don't expect instant perfection** - learning takes time and data
- **Don't over-report the same pattern** - one report per pattern type is usually enough
- **Don't ignore the daily learning limits** - system prevents over-tuning for stability
