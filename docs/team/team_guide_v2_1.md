## 📋 Response Procedures

### High-Priority Crisis Response

**Step 1: Immediate Assessment (0-30 seconds)**
```
□ Read the full context of the crisis alert
□ Check user's recent message history for additional context
□ Assess immediate safety concerns
□ Determine if emergency services may be needed
□ Claim the case in #team-coordination
```

**Step 2: Initial Contact (30 seconds - 2 minutes)**
```
□ Send immediate supportive DM to the user
□ Use empathetic, non-judgmental language
□ Ask for consent to continue the conversation
□ Provide immediate safety resources
□ Assure them they are not alone
```

**Example Initial DM:**
> "Hi [Name], I noticed you might be going through a really tough time right now. I'm [Your Name] from the Crisis Response Team, and I want you to know that you're not alone. Would it be okay if we talked for a bit? I'm here to listen and support you. 💜"

**Step 3: Safety Assessment (2-10 minutes)**
```
□ Assess immediate safety and suicide risk
□ Ask directly about suicidal thoughts if indicated
□ Determine if user has access to means of self-harm
□ Identify protective factors (family, pets, goals)
□ Evaluate need for emergency intervention
```

**Safety Assessment Questions:**
- "Are you thinking about hurting yourself?"
- "Do you have thoughts of suicide?"
- "Do you have a plan for how you might hurt yourself?"
- "What's keeping you safe right now?"
- "Who in your life can you reach out to for support?"

**Step 4: Support and Resources (10-30 minutes)**
```
□ Provide emotional support and validation
□ Share appropriate crisis resources
□ Help develop immediate safety plan
□ Connect with local resources if possible
□ Arrange follow-up support
```

**Step 5: Documentation and Follow-up**
```
□ Document the interaction in the case management system
□ Schedule appropriate follow-up timeline
□ Brief team lead on high-risk cases
□ Coordinate with other team members as needed
□ Update case status in the dashboard
```
