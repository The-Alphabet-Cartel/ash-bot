- "dysphoria overwhelming me"
- "family rejection hitting hard" 
- "closet suffocating"
- "transition doubts consuming"

Generational Language:
- "no cap feeling hopeless"
- "lowkey having suicidal thoughts"
- "straight up want to disappear"
- "fr can't handle this anymore"

Subtle Crisis Indicators:
- "not doing so hot"
- "pretty rough lately"
- "things feel impossible"
- "really not okay"
```

**❌ Keywords to Avoid:**
```
Gaming/Entertainment:
- "killed", "murdered", "destroyed" (without context)
- "dead" (from laughter/tiredness)
- "rekt", "pwned", "annihilated"

Work/School Stress (without crisis context):
- "homework killing me"
- "work destroying me"
- "deadline crushing me"

Casual Expressions:
- "I'm dying" (laughter)
- "so dead" (tired)
- "killing time"
```

### **Strategic Learning System Usage**

**Report False Positives When:**
- **Gaming Discussion:** Ash flagged competitive gaming language as crisis
- **Entertainment Content:** Movie/TV/book discussions misinterpreted
- **Hyperbolic Expression:** Casual exaggerations detected as crisis
- **Work/Academic Stress:** Normal pressure misidentified as crisis

**Report Missed Crises When:**
- **Community-Specific Language:** Local expressions for distress not recognized
- **Identity-Specific Distress:** LGBTQIA+ specific crisis language missed
- **Subtle Crisis Signals:** Understated distress expressions overlooked
- **Cultural/Generational Patterns:** Age or cultural-specific crisis language

**Optimize Learning with Context:**
```
Good Context Examples:
- "User was discussing video game boss fight strategies"
- "Reference to movie character death scene"
- "Community-specific way of expressing gender dysphoria"
- "Subtle cry for help using local slang"

Poor Context Examples:
- "False positive" (no explanation)
- "Wrong" (not helpful for learning)
- "Obvious mistake" (lacks specifics)
```

## 🚫 Critical Guidelines

### **What NOT to Do**

**Crisis Response:**
- **Never ignore alerts** - Even low priority requires awareness
- **Don't assume others will respond** - Coordinate explicitly in crisis channel
- **Don't overwhelm the person** - One primary responder, others provide support
- **Don't dismiss context** - Community language may seem unusual but be valid

**Learning System:**
- **Don't report hastily** - Consider context and patterns carefully
- **Don't expect instant perfection** - Learning requires time and consistent data
- **Don't over-report same patterns** - One detailed report per pattern type usually sufficient
- **Don't ignore daily learning limits** - System prevents over-tuning for stability

**Keyword Management:**
- **Don't add keywords without team discussion** - May increase false positives
- **Don't remove keywords that work** - Check with team first
- **Don't add overly broad terms** - Specificity prevents false alerts
- **Don't forget community context** - Consider how language is actually used

### **Learning System Cautions**

**Avoid Over-Training:**
- Maximum 50 learning adjustments per day prevents system instability
- Focus on clear, significant errors rather than minor edge cases
- Allow time for patterns to stabilize before making additional adjustments

**Context is Critical:**
- Always provide detailed context in learning reports
- Consider how community uses language differently than general population
- Account for LGBTQIA+ specific terminology and cultural patterns
