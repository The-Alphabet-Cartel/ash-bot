# üñ§ Ash Bot v1.1 - "Community-Powered Detection"

> *Now with real-time keyword management and Claude 4 intelligence*

## üéâ Major Feature Release

This release introduces **custom keyword management** via slash commands, allowing Crisis Response teams to adapt Ash's detection capabilities to their community's unique language patterns in real-time. Plus upgraded intelligence with **Claude 4 Sonnet** for more empathetic and accurate responses.

## ‚≠ê What's New in v1.1

### üõ†Ô∏è **Custom Keyword Management** (Major Feature)

- **`/add_keyword`** - Add community-specific crisis language
- **`/remove_keyword`** - Remove problematic keywords causing false positives  
- **`/list_keywords`** - View all custom keywords for any crisis level
- **`/keyword_stats`** - See comprehensive keyword statistics

**Key Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Immediate activation** - no restart or technical intervention required
- ‚úÖ **Role-based security** - only Crisis Response team can modify
- ‚úÖ **Complete audit trail** - tracks who changed what and when
- ‚úÖ **Community adaptation** - customize for LGBTQIA+ specific language
- ‚úÖ **False positive management** - quickly remove problematic phrases

### üß† **Claude 4 Sonnet Integration**
- **Enhanced reasoning** and more nuanced emotional understanding
- **Better instruction following** for crisis response protocols
- **Improved empathy** in responses to community members
- **Advanced context awareness** for complex mental health situations

### üîó **Hybrid Detection System**
- **Primary**: Enhanced keyword matching (built-in + custom)
- **Backup**: Remote ML analysis for missed patterns
- **Redundancy**: Multiple detection methods ensure better coverage

### üìä **Enhanced Monitoring & Analytics**
- **Real-time keyword effectiveness** tracking
- **Usage statistics** for slash commands
- **Audit logs** with user attribution and timestamps
- **Performance metrics** for custom vs built-in keyword success rates

## üéØ Crisis Response Team Empowerment

### Before v1.1
- **Static detection** - required developer intervention for new keywords
- **Generic patterns** - couldn't adapt to community-specific language
- **Slow iteration** - keyword updates required code changes and deployments

### After v1.1
- **Dynamic adaptation** - team manages keywords in real-time
- **Community-specific** - detect language patterns unique to your members
- **Immediate response** - add new detection patterns as community evolves

### Example Use Cases
```bash
# Add transition-specific crisis language
/add_keyword crisis_level:High Crisis keyword:transition regret overwhelming

# Add community slang for depression
/add_keyword crisis_level:Medium Crisis keyword:big sad energy

# Remove false positive
/remove_keyword crisis_level:Low Crisis keyword:dead tired

# Monitor team's keyword management
/keyword_stats
```

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Improvements

### New Components
- **`crisis_commands.py`** - Slash command system with role-based access
- **`custom_keywords.json`** - Persistent storage for team-managed keywords
- **Enhanced `keyword_detector.py`** - Real-time keyword loading
- **`nlp_integration.py`** - ML backup detection system

### Infrastructure Updates
- **Global slash command sync** - more reliable than guild-specific commands

- **Reduced false positives** - team can remove problematic patterns
- **Better LGBTQIA+ support** - community-specific crisis terminology
- **Faster pattern updates** - immediate vs weeks for code changes

### Team Efficiency  
- **Self-service management** - no developer dependency for keyword updates
- **Real-time adaptation** - respond to new crisis language patterns immediately
- **Better coordination** - shared visibility into detection capabilities
- **Audit transparency** - track all keyword management decisions

## üõ°Ô∏è Enhanced Security

### Access Control
- **Role-based permissions** - only CrisisResponse role can use slash commands
- **Command logging** - full audit trail of all keyword modifications
- **Input validation** - prevent malicious or problematic keyword injection
- **Private responses** - command responses only visible to user

### Data Protection
- **Persistent storage** - custom keywords survive restarts and updates
- **Backup integrity** - keyword data protected with metadata
- **Change attribution** - track which team member made which changes
- **Rollback capability** - ability to remove problematic additions

## üîÑ Migration & Compatibility

### Upgrading from v1.0
1. **Automatic**: Existing keywords continue working unchanged
2. **New features**: Slash commands available immediately after deployment
3. **Backward compatible**: All v1.0 functionality preserved
4. **Database migration**: Auto-creates custom keyword storage

### Breaking Changes
- **None** - v1.1 is fully backward compatible with v1.0

### New Requirements
- **Discord permissions**: Bot needs `applications.commands` scope
- **Role configuration**: `CRISIS_RESPONSE_ROLE_ID` environment variable
- **Additional storage**: `./data/` directory for custom keywords

## üí∞ Cost Impact

### API Usage
- **Claude 4 pricing**: $3/$15 per million tokens (input/output)
- **Same cost controls**: Daily limits and per-user rate limiting maintained
- **Estimated impact**: 10-20% increase due to improved model capabilities
- **Better efficiency**: More accurate responses may reduce conversation length

### Resource Usage
- **Minimal overhead**: Slash commands add negligible resource usage
- **Storage**: Custom keywords require minimal disk space
- **Memory**: Slight increase for real-time keyword management

## üöÄ Deployment

### New Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for slash commands
CRISIS_RESPONSE_ROLE_ID=your_crisis_team_role_id

# Optional display names (for user-facing messages)
RESOURCES_CHANNEL_NAME=resources
CRISIS_RESPONSE_ROLE_NAME=CrisisResponse
STAFF_PING_NAME=StaffUserName

# Optional NLP backup service
NLP_SERVICE_HOST=your_ai_rig_ip
NLP_SERVICE_PORT=8001
```

### Deployment Steps
1. **Update environment** - add new required variables
2. **Re-invite bot** - ensure `applications.commands` scope
3. **Deploy v1.1** - `docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d`
4. **Verify commands** - check logs for successful slash command sync
5. **Test access** - Crisis Response members can see slash commands

### Verification
```bash
# Check successful deployment
docker-compose logs ash | grep "Global sync successful"

# Should see: "‚úÖ Global sync successful: 4 commands"
```
